This blog post continues from the previous post in a discussion of the use of LLMs in the design and programming of computational cognitive models. 

Since the last time I attempted to use a chatbot to help in my work designing and programming computational cognitive models there has already been a new major model released by OpenAI. The GPT-4.5 model has a smaller context window than o3, but is newer, meaning it has access to more recent information in the form of documents used to train the model. However, both are able to generate queries to look up information using the internet as a part of their internal chain of thought prompt reasoning process. So I thought it would be interesting to see how this new model fairs in terms of designing a computational cognitive model based on the following prompt: 

"Using the python programming package PyIBL, create a model of an undergraduate student that can predict their decision making when they choose the time that they are going to fall asleep. Using the attached dataset of student decisions, the description of the variables, and the code book, come up with ten attributes that the model might use to determine the time that the student will go to sleep. Also create a reward function that will determine how much the student is rewarded based on the amount of time that the sleep."

One interesting thing is that the model actually ran a python script to output the names of the columns in the dataset that I provided. I have removed the columns from the generated code as the data is not publically available. One of the issues with this is that the names of the columns aren't totally obvious as to what they mean in terms of the attributes of the student that is trying to make the decision of when to fall asleep:

```
Result
['ID',
 '******']
```

Nevertheless the model did attempt to make an IBL model that predicted the decision making of the student using 10 of these attributes, which generated the following code:

```python 
# Example Implementation Using PyIBL
from pyibl import Agent

# Define attributes based on dataset exploration
attributes = [
    '******'
]

# Define the reward function based on sleep duration
def sleep_reward(sleep_duration):
    """
    Rewards students for sleeping 8 hours or more, penalizes for less than 4 hours.
    """
    if sleep_duration >= 8:
        return 10
    elif sleep_duration <= 4:
        return -10
    else:
        return 2.5 * (sleep_duration - 4) - 10

# Initialize the PyIBL agent
student_agent = Agent(attributes=attributes, name="StudentSleepDecisionAgent")

# Example scenario to populate agent with hypothetical data
example_attributes = {
    '******'
}

# Hypothetical decision scenario
agent = Agent(attributes=attributes)
choice = agent.choose([example_attributes])
sleep_duration = 7  # Example sleep duration
reward = sleep_reward(sleep_duration)
agent.respond(reward)

# The agent now learns from this experience and updates its decision-making accordingly.
```

When the ChatGPT 4.5 agent tries to run the code it has generated during its analysis, it runs into the following error: 

```
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[3], line 2
      1 # Sample code using PyIBL to create the student sleep decision model
----> 2 from pyibl import Agent
      4 # Define a simple reward function based on sleep duration
      5 def sleep_reward(sleep_hours):

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyibl'
```

This is an issue because the model isn't installing pyibl before trying to run the code. This is interesting since the o3 model was able to correctly install pyibl and run the example code. But that isn't necessarily proof that the 4.5 model can't do this, just that it didn't try that on this run. Next I am going to ask the model to install the pyibl package before running the code and try to compare the performance of the model it designed with the humans in the dataset. 

```
Make sure to run 'pip install pyibl' before running code that imports pyibl. After doing this, run a simulation of the model you created and compare it's decision making to the human students in this study dataset
```

```python 
# Before running this, make sure PyIBL is installed using:
# pip install pyibl

from pyibl import Agent
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('******.csv')

# Define reward function based on sleep duration
def sleep_reward(sleep_duration):
    if sleep_duration >= 8:
        return 10
    elif sleep_duration <= 4:
        return -10
    else:
        return 2.5 * (sleep_duration - 4) - 10

# Attributes selected based on dataset exploration
attributes = [
    "****" 
]

# Initialize agent
student_agent = Agent(attributes=attributes, default_utility=0)

# Simulate decisions for each student record
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    situation = {attr: row.get(attr, 0) for attr in attributes}
    sleep_time = row.get('******', '0:00')
    wake_time = row.get('******', '0:00')

    # Convert sleep and wake times to hours
    sleep_hour = int(sleep_time.split(':')[0])
    wake_hour = int(wake_time.split(':')[0])
    sleep_duration = wake_hour - sleep_hour if wake_hour >= sleep_hour else 24 + wake_hour - sleep_hour

    # Initialize agent for each student
    student_agent = Agent(attributes=attributes)

    # Make decision and respond
    decision = student_agent.choose([row[attributes].to_dict() for _, row in data.iterrows()])
    student_agent.respond(sleep_reward(sleep_duration=sleep_hour))

    print(f"Predicted sleep decision attributes: {decision}, Reward: {sleep_reward(sleep_duration)}")

```

This code didn't run beacuse there was a case of duplicate options, if the gpt4.5 model was able to install the pyibl library or just simulate an environment where the pyibl agent can be imported from the python file that I included, then it might have been more successful. Just to give the model one more change I told it the error below and asked it to fix the issue:

```
The above code ran into the following error:

DtypeWarning: Columns (7,8,9,10,12,13,15) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise ValueError("duplicate choices")
ValueError: duplicate choices

Can you fix it? 
```

```python 
# Before running this, make sure PyIBL is installed using:
# pip install pyibl

from pyibl import Agent
import pandas as pd

# Load data with low_memory to prevent warnings
data = pd.read_csv('phase1_data.csv', low_memory=False)

# Define reward function
def sleep_reward(sleep_duration):
    if sleep_duration >= 8:
        return 10
    elif sleep_duration <= 4:
        return -10
    else:
        return 2.5 * (sleep_duration - 4) - 10

# Selected attributes
attributes = [
    "Fatigue_1", "Fatigue_2", "Social_1", "Social_2",
    "exercise", "workload_1", "workload_2", "SubstanceUse_6_7",
    "Social_3", "Stress_3"
]

# Initialize agent
student_agent = Agent(attributes=attributes, default_utility=0)

# Remove rows with missing attributes
clean_data = data.dropna(subset=attributes + ['Sleep_1t_Cleaned', 'Sleep_2t'])

# Simulate agent's decisions
for index, row in clean_data.iterrows():
    situation = {attr: row[attr] for attr in attributes}
    
    # Convert sleep and wake times to hours
    sleep_hour = int(row['Sleep_1t_Cleaned'].split(':')[0])
    wake_hour = int(row['Sleep_2t'].split(':')[0])
    sleep_duration = wake_hour - sleep_hour if wake_hour >= sleep_hour else 24 + wake_hour - sleep_hour
    
    student_agent.populate([situation], sleep_reward(sleep_hour))

# After populating, run a new prediction
unique_situations = clean_data[attributes].drop_duplicates().to_dict('records')

for situation in unique_situations:
    decision = student_agent.choose([situation])
    print(f"Situation: {situation} => Predicted decision: {decision}")

```

The above code also didn't run because the model was using the column Sleep_2t instead of Sleep_2t_Cleaned for some reason even though it was correctly using Sleep_1t_Cleaned. That alone didn't fully fix it because the code is trying to call a choice from the pyibl model before telling it what the reward from the last choice was. Since this is a fairly basic requirement of pyibl models I am going to call it there and say that the fully agentic programming of computational cognitive modeling may be unatainable with simple prompting, at least for now.
